ony is among the most reputed brands when it comes to audio products, including a variety of headsets. Its WH-1000XM3 Bluetooth headphones with active noise cancellation (ANC) have been widely appreciated for their sound quality, comfort, and battery longevity. Last month, Sony revealed their successor globally, and now, the Sony WH-1000XM4 ANC headphones are coming to India for a price of ₹29,990 (~$410).

While in terms of design, the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones look almost identical to the WH-1000XM3’s, there are some new changes under the hood. Starting with the hardware changes, the XM4 feature a new proximity sensor inside the left earcup to automatically pause audio when you take the headphones off and resume it when you put them back on. Meanwhile, the new Bluetooth Audio processor (the MediaTek MT2811S) senses and adjusts to the noise up to 700 times each second.

Things that remain unchanged include the headphones’ basic design, the touchpad on the earcups to control playback, or activate the ambient sound gesture. The Sony WH-1000XM4 use the same 40mm drivers from the last generation but feature software upscaling to improve the audio output.

Sony has also introduced a new “Speak-to-Chat” feature that automatically pauses music when you start speaking based on the input from the inbuilt mics. Sony also claims that apart from your voice, it utilizes bone conduction to sense vibrations from your jaws to differentiate between your voice and any other ambient sound.
